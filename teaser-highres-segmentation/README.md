# Dash App for Segmentation of High-Resolution Images [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black) [![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)


This application is built using Plotly's [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) framework and provides a web-based interface for visualizing and annotating high resolution images output from [ALS](https://als.lbl.gov/) beamlines. 

Image data is accessed via a [Tiled](https://github.com/bluesky/tiled) client, which provides chunkwise access to multidimensional TIFF sequences.

## How to use?

### Local development setup

1. Create a new Python virtual environment and install the project dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and 

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

2. Set environment variables via a `.env` file to configure a connection to the Tiled server, differentiate between local testing and development mode and set a user and password for basic autherization:

```
TILED_URI='https://tiled-seg.als.lbl.gov'
TILED_API_KEY=<key-provided-on-request>
DASH_DEPLOYMENT_LOC='Local'
MODE='dev'
```

3. Start a local server: 

```
python app.py
```

### Local tiled connection

Developers may also choose to set up a local Tiled server with access to minimal datasets (eg. in the case that the remote server is down).

To start local tiled connection:
1. Add `TILED_DEPLOYMENT_LOC="Local"` flag to `.env` file (or to your environmental variables)
2. Start the app once, which will create `data/` directory and download 2 sample projects with 2 images each.
3. Open a second terminal and run `/tiled_serve_dir.sh`.

The app will now connect to the local tiled server.

### Deployment elsewhere

For deployment elsewhere add a user name and password to the environment file and remove `DASH_DEPLOYMENT_LOC = "Local"`. This protect access to the application with basic authentication:

```
USER_NAME=<to-be-specified-per-deployment>
USER_PASSWORD=<to-be-specified-per-deployment>
```
