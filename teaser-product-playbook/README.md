## Product Playbook
A full-fledged application illustrating the depth of capabailities of a Dash app: Nested tabs, a multitude of visuals, dynamic filtering, location data, and tabular data. The app allows a user to drill into information about a set of products and learn more about the location, presentation, and site for those products and interact with that information using several graphing styles.

The app also includes a "product playbook", which shows overview data and textual information about each individual product, broken down into several unique sections.
